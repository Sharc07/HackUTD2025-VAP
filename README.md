# 🚗 Toyota Vision – Drive Your Future, Virtually

## ✨ Inspiration
Finding your perfect car is hard when you can’t truly experience it — especially on the roads you know best. Many users lack access to nearby dealerships or test drives. **Toyota Vision** bridges that gap with AI-driven personalization and an immersive virtual driving experience, embodying Toyota’s commitment to **innovation, accessibility, and customer experience**.

---

## 💡 What It Does
**Toyota Vision** is a prototype that combines **AI insights** with a **3D driving simulator**.  
Our intelligent assistant, **Yota**, uses the user’s ZIP code to analyze local weather, population, and road conditions — then recommends Toyota models that best fit their environment.  
Users can then **virtually drive** their selected car in realistic weather, lighting, and terrain conditions, making the shopping experience personal and engaging.

## 🏗️ How We Built It
- Designed the complete user flow — from onboarding to simulation.
- Built the frontend using **React 18**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Lucide React** for a responsive and modern interface.
- Integrated **Google Maps, Street View, and Geocoding APIs** to render real-world routes.
- Used the **Gemini API** for AI-powered recommendations and smart debugging.
- Developed a **Python backend** to process user data and serve personalized car suggestions in real time.
